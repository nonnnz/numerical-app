# 🧮 Numerical Methods Application

Welcome to the **Numerical Methods Application**, a powerful tool designed for a course project that combines advanced computation, iteration tracking, and graph visualization in one seamless platform. Built using **Next.js**, **Convex**, and **Clerk**, this application ensures a smooth user experience with robust authentication and efficient data management.

## 🚀 Features

### ✏️ Numerical Calculations

- Perform complex numerical computations with ease.
- Supports a variety of methods including interpolation, root finding, integration, and more.

### 🔒 Seamless User Authentication

- Powered by **Clerk**, ensuring secure and hassle-free login.
- Support for multiple authentication methods (e.g., email, OAuth, etc.).

### 🌐 Real-Time Data Management

- Backed by **Convex** for real-time, serverless data storage and synchronization.
- Effortlessly manage your computations and user data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: Fast, modern React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Convex**: Real-time, serverless database for seamless data management.
- **Clerk**: Simplified, secure authentication for modern applications.
